In the context of the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, here's how the COBOL code can be translated into different .NET code file types:

### 1. **Model Layer**
   - **Inventory.cs**: This model represents the `InventoryRecord` structure. It will include properties for `InventoryID`, `ItemName`, `QuantityOnHand`, `ReorderLevel`, `Price`, and `LastUpdatedDate`.
   - **AuditRecord.cs**: This model represents the audit logs and includes properties for storing audit data.
   - **ImportDataModel.cs** and **ExportDataModel.cs**: Models for handling import and export operations, representing the data structure used in those processes.

### 2. **View Layer**
   - **InventoryViews.cshtml**: Views (Razor files) for displaying inventory data. These might include:
     - **AddItem.cshtml**: A form for adding a new inventory item.
     - **UpdateItem.cshtml**: A form for updating an existing inventory item.
     - **ViewInventory.cshtml**: A view to list all inventory items.
     - **DeleteItem.cshtml**: A form or confirmation dialog for deleting an inventory item.
     - **Reports.cshtml**: Views for generating and displaying reports, like reorder reports, low stock alerts, and inventory summaries.

### 3. **Controller Layer**
   - **InventoryController.cs**: This controller handles user interactions, processes requests, and returns views. It would contain actions corresponding to each operation in the COBOL program:
     - `AddItem()`: Handles the logic for adding a new item.
     - `UpdateItem()`: Handles the logic for updating an existing item.
     - `DeleteItem()`: Handles the logic for deleting an item.
     - `ViewInventory()`: Fetches and displays the inventory list.
     - `GenerateReorderReport()`: Generates a reorder report.
     - `SearchItemByName()`: Searches items by name.
     - `CalculateTotalInventoryValue()`: Calculates the total value of inventory.
     - `GenerateLowStockAlert()`: Generates a low stock alert.
     - `ExportInventoryData()`: Handles data export functionality.
     - `ImportInventoryData()`: Handles data import functionality.
   
### 4. **Data Access Layer (Repository)**
   - **InventoryRepository.cs**: This repository interfaces with the data source (file system or database) and handles CRUD operations for inventory records. Methods might include:
     - `GetInventoryById()`
     - `GetAllInventory()`
     - `AddInventory()`
     - `UpdateInventory()`
     - `DeleteInventory()`
   - **AuditRepository.cs**: Handles logging audit data to the audit log file.
   - **ImportExportRepository.cs**: Handles data import and export operations.

### 5. **Service Layer (Optional)**
   - **InventoryService.cs**: Contains the business logic for inventory operations, such as calculating totals, checking reorder levels, and updating prices. The controller calls this service to process data before sending it to the view.
   - **ReportService.cs**: Handles the logic for generating various reports, like inventory summaries and reorder reports.

### 6. **Utilities**
   - **FileHelper.cs**: Utility class for handling file operations, such as reading from and writing to files.
   - **DateHelper.cs**: Utility class for managing date-related operations, like formatting dates.

In this architecture, the **Controller** handles user inputs and actions, interacts with the **Model** (data and business logic), and returns appropriate **Views** (UI) to the user. The **Repository** or **Data Access Layer** is responsible for interacting with the data source, while the **Service Layer** can be used for additional business logic that doesn't fit neatly into the model or controller.
