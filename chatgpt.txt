For migrating COBOL to .NET MVC using generative AI, here’s a high-level strategy you can consider to handle the complexity:

1. Understand and Extract the System Components

	•	Main COBOL files (8000 lines each): Break down the logic into smaller sections (procedures or functions) that can be mapped to corresponding .NET MVC actions or methods.
	•	Subroutines (1000 lines each): Isolate the subroutines and map them into reusable services or components in .NET. For COBOL subroutines that call embedded C, determine if they need to be rewritten or can be wrapped as native C/C++ DLLs for use in .NET.

2. Modular Conversion with Generative AI

Use AI to handle the repetitive or structured parts of the migration:

	•	Automate COBOL-to-C# Code Generation: Train or fine-tune a language model to recognize common COBOL patterns (PERFORM, IF/ELSE, READ/WRITE) and suggest corresponding C# code.
	•	Migrate Subroutines as Services: Use AI to identify subroutine boundaries and their inputs/outputs, translating them into C# services or helper classes.
	•	Maintain Clean Separation: Ensure AI models preserve the structure and modularity during conversion. This helps keep business logic clean and separated from UI logic.

3. Frontend Migration (HTML/JS Integration)

	•	Identify where the COBOL integrates with the frontend and use generative models to refactor those interactions into modern frontend frameworks like React or Razor Pages (MVC).
	•	Migrate the legacy HTML and JavaScript files into .NET-compatible Razor views and components.
	•	You can leverage AI to generate the C#-based MVC controllers and models that interact with the migrated frontend.

4. Data Migration and I/O Handling

	•	Use AI to help migrate legacy file I/O handling in COBOL into modern database interactions (e.g., Entity Framework in .NET).
	•	Automate transformation of COBOL record structures to C# models, preserving field types and names.

5. Handling Embedded C Calls

	•	For C subroutine calls, either:
	•	Wrap the C code in a native DLL and call it from .NET, or
	•	Migrate the C logic to C# if possible, using AI models trained to convert C to C#.

6. Validation & Testing Automation

	•	AI can assist in generating unit tests for the migrated code, ensuring functional parity between the COBOL logic and the generated C# code.
	•	Auto-generate test cases based on COBOL input/output and edge cases.

7. Iterative Migration and Hybrid Co-existence

	•	You can opt for a phased migration where COBOL and .NET MVC coexist until the complete system is migrated. AI can assist in this hybrid model, generating wrappers and APIs for communication between old and new components.
