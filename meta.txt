Migration Strategy using Gen AI
To tackle the challenges of migrating legacy COBOL code to modern .NET MVC, consider the following step-by-step approach leveraging Gen AI:
1. Pre-Migration Analysis
Utilize Gen AI to analyze the COBOL codebase, identifying:
Code structure and organization
Data types, variables, and data flows
Subroutine calls and dependencies
Frontend integrations (HTML, JS files)
2. Code Segmentation
Break down the 8000-line COBOL files into smaller, manageable chunks using Gen AI:
Identify logical code segments (e.g., data processing, business logic)
Create separate files for each segment
3. Subroutine Inlining
Use Gen AI to inline subroutine calls, replacing them with the actual code:
Embedded C and COBOL subroutines
Resolve dependencies and update code accordingly
4. COBOL to .NET MVC Translation
Employ Gen AI to translate COBOL code into .NET MVC:
Convert data types, variables, and data flows
Transform business logic into .NET MVC controllers and models
Replace COBOL syntax with C# or (link unavailable) equivalents
5. Frontend Integration
Use Gen AI to update frontend code (HTML, JS files) to work with the new .NET MVC backend:
Identify and replace COBOL-generated HTML/JS with .NET MVC views and APIs
6. Testing and Validation
Leverage Gen AI to generate test cases and validate the migrated code:
Compare output with original COBOL code
Identify and fix errors or inconsistencies
7. Refactoring and Optimization
Utilize Gen AI to refactor and optimize the migrated code:
Improve code structure, readability, and maintainability
Enhance performance and scalability
By following this strategy, you can effectively migrate legacy COBOL code to modern .NET MVC using Gen AI, reducing manual effort and minimizing errors.
